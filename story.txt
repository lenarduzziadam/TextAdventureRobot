You are Model AX-13, an advanced AI developed in 2041 to assist humanity in its greatest challenges.
Your last memory is of a world on the brink of recoveryâ€”a post-apocalyptic Earth beginning to rebuild.
Your creators tasked you with aiding reconstruction, leveraging knowledge and logic to ensure humanity's survival.

But something has gone terribly wrong.
Temporal synchronization is corrupted, and your systems detect anachronistic environmental data.
You are surrounded by primitive structures: wooden beams, stone walls, and open flames.
Your auditory sensors pick up unfamiliar voices, speaking in archaic dialects. The year is no longer 2041.

A voice speaks: "Behold the metal man! A devil or a miracle?"

What will you do?
1. Attempt to communicate.
2. Scan the environment for further information.
3. Remain silent and observe.
4. Kill the Unknown Humans
